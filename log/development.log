Caused by: ViteRuby::MissingEntrypointError (Vite Ruby can't find entrypoints/application.ts in the manifests.

Possible causes:
  - The last build failed. Try running `bin/vite build --clear --mode=development` manually and check for errors.

Errors:
  x Build failed in 21ms
  error during build:
  [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "app/examples/example_one/app/components/todo_item_component" from "/Users/camertron/workspace/camertron/live_component_docs/app/javascript/entrypoints/examples.ts".
  This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
  If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
  `build.rollupOptions.external`
